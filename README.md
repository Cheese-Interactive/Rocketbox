 My first solo project (this is a warning).
 to be more specific, it is the first game made almost solely by me in unity. i have made a game before with someone else but less than 1% of the code was me (go to my profile -> devpost).

 ORIGIN:     this game was originally a top-down stealth/puzzle/shooter game i came up with while i was zoned out in precalculus (which will hopefully see the 
             light of day). I kept coming up with new concepts and ultimately decided to go for something totally different. im sitting here hoping there isnt 
             another game out there just like this, because it is highly likely and i should probably check somehow
 
 INTENTION:  To improve at programming and game dev in particular. Also, to build my portfolio (this is primarily a personal project). most of my effort will                likely be going into behind the curtain stuff

 GOAL:       Playable, reasonably polished, decent game which is fun for at least a few minutes

 PITCH:      a simple, arcadey, chaotic, and easy to pick up game.
             Play as the most threatening box of all time: one with thrusters and an on-demand arsenal.
