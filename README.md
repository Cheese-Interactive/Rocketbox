- This is my first solo project 
 
## ORIGIN:     
this game was originally a top-down stealth/puzzle/shooter game i came up with while i was zoned out in precalculus (which will hopefully see the light of day). I kept coming up with new concepts and ultimately decided to go for something totally different. 
 
## INTENTION:  
to improve at programming and game dev in particular

 ## GOAL:       
 playable, reasonably polished, decent game which is fun for at least a few minutes

 ## PITCH:      
 a simple, arcadey, chaotic, and easy to pick up game. Play as the most threatening box of all time: one with thrusters and an on-demand arsenal.
