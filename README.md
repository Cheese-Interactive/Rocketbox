# About this project
 My first solo project. to be more specific, it is the first game made almost solely by me in unity. i have made a game before with someone else but less than 1% of the code was me (go to my profile -> devpost).

# ORIGIN:     
this game was originally a top-down stealth/puzzle/shooter game i came up with while i was zoned out in precalculus (which will hopefully see the light of day). I kept coming up with new concepts and ultimately decided to go for something totally different. 
 
# INTENTION:  
To improve at programming and game dev in particular

 # GOAL:       
 Playable, reasonably polished, decent game which is fun for at least a few minutes

 # PITCH:      
 a simple, arcadey, chaotic, and easy to pick up game. Play as the most threatening box of all time: one with thrusters and an on-demand arsenal.
